# 1.Employee Management System (C++)
Description:
The Employee Management System is a C++ console application designed to manage employee records, including adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting employee data. It includes a secure login system and user-friendly navigation.

Features:
✅ Secure Login: Authentication system with user credentials.
✅ Add, Update, View, and Delete Employee Records: Manage employee data.
✅ Search Employee Records: Allows searching for employees based on different criteria.
✅ Logout: Users can log out after their session.
Technologies Used:
C++: Main programming language for developing the system.
File Handling: For storing employee data persistently.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Structured using classes and objects.

# 2. Library Management System (C++)
Description:
The Library Management System is a C++ application designed to manage books and users in a library. It allows the addition of new books, checking out books, viewing available books, and returning borrowed books.

Features:
✅ Add New Books: Admin can add books to the library catalog.
✅ Check-out and Return Books: Allows users to borrow and return books.
✅ Search Books: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre.
✅ View Available Books: Displays a list of books available for checkout.
Technologies Used:
C++: Core language for implementation.
File Handling: To manage the library records.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): To structure the system into classes like Book, User, and Admin.

# 3. Bank Account Management System (C++)
Description:
The Bank Account Management System is a C++ console application that allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, and check account balances. It simulates basic banking operations.

Features:
✅ Create a New Bank Account: Users can create their bank account.
✅ Deposit Funds: Users can deposit money into their account.
✅ Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw money from their account.
✅ Check Account Balance: Displays the current balance of the account.
Technologies Used:
C++: Programming language for the system.
File Handling: To store user bank data securely.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Using classes to represent Bank Account and Transactions.

# 4. Simple Calculator (C++)
Description:
A simple Calculator application built in C++ to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:
✅ Addition: Performs the addition of two numbers.
✅ Subtraction: Performs the subtraction of two numbers.
✅ Multiplication: Performs multiplication.
✅ Division: Performs division with input validation for zero division error.
Technologies Used:
C++: Core programming language.
Input Validation: To handle user input errors.

# 5. To-Do List Application (C++)
Description:
A To-Do List application that allows users to add tasks, view pending tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.

Features:
✅ Add New Task: Users can add a new task to the list.
✅ Mark Task as Completed: Allows users to mark a task as done.
✅ View Pending Tasks: Displays tasks that have not been completed.
✅ Delete Task: Allows users to remove a task from the list.
Technologies Used:
C++: Programming language for the project.
File Handling: To persist tasks data.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Task management through classes.

# 6. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (C++)
Description:
A Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in C++ where two players can play against each other on the console. The game tracks the game board and determines the winner or if there’s a draw.

Features:
✅ Two-Player Mode: Two players can play against each other.
✅ Game Board Display: Displays the current game board after every move.
✅ Win or Draw Check: Checks for a winner or a draw.
Technologies Used:
C++: Main programming language.
Logic Implementation: To manage the game flow and check for wins.
